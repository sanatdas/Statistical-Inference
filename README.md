# Part 1: A simulation exercise

In this project, we investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. As per instructions provided in the project, set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. We will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. Note that we will need to do a thousand simulations.

Using simulation and associated explanatory text, need to illustrate the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponential instances to: 

1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
2. Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.

# Part 2: Basic inferential data analysis

In the second part, we're going to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package. 

1. Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses 
2. Provide a basic summary of the data.
3. Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if there's other approaches worth considering)
4. State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.
